What's new in v0.5?
===================

Python 3 compatibility
----------------------

Glue v0.5 is now fully compatible with Python 3, fixes compatibility with 2.6, and remains compatible with Python 2.7.

Installation with Anaconda/conda
--------------------------------

If you make use of Anaconda or Miniconda, Glue can now be installed very easily by doing::

    conda install glueviz

This will install glue itself as well as all of the required and many
optional dependencies.

New features
------------

Glue v0.5 includes a number of new features, in particular:

* The ability to :ref:`include a copy of all datasets <saving_session>` in
  ``.glu`` session files, to make it easier to exchange session files with
  other users (when saving a session file, choose the option to include all
  data from the drop-down menu).

* The ability to write and register
  :ref:`custom data importers <custom_importers>`, as well as
  :ref:`custom menubar tools <custom_menubar_tools>`.
  
* An improved interface for :ref:`creating new components <new_components>`,
  including tab-completion and color highlighting of component names.

* The ability to specify plugins to load by :ref:`providing the name of a plugin package <lazy_load_plugin>`,
  rather than having to import it explicitly.
  
* The ability to pass ``HDUList`` objects when using ``qglue``.

* The ability to use the ``load_ui`` function in external plugins.

* The Astronomy coordinate system transformations now include more coordinate
  frames.

Improvements
------------

In addition to the new features described above, we have made a number of
internal improvements to the code structure, and have fixed a number of
usability bugs reported by users.
