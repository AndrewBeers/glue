What's new in Glue v0.8?
========================

Below we list some of the main changes in Glue v0.8. As a reminder, you can
easily update glue if you are using Anaconda/Miniconda, by doing::

    conda install -c conda-forge glueviz

If instead you installed glue with pip, you can update with::

    pip install glueviz --upgrade

Playback controls for image slicing
-----------------------------------

When using the image viewer to view datasets with more than two dimensions, the sliders snow include playback controls that you can use to animate the slicing.

By clicking multiple times on the play forward or play back button (the buttons on either side of the stop button), you can speed up the animation.

Improved new component window
-----------------------------

The *Define New Component* window has now been significantly improved. The syntax of the expression for the new component is now validated on-the-fly, and the component cannot be created until the expression validates:

Improved feedback window
------------------------

The *Send Feedback* functionality available through the Help menu and the windo
to send crash reports to the developers now also provide the option to specify
an email address in case you want to be contacted about the feedback/bug report:
