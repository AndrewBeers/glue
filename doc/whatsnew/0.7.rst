What's new in Glue v0.7?
========================

Below we list some of the main changes in Glue v0.7. As a reminder, you can
easily update glue if you are using Anaconda/Miniconda, by doing::

    conda install glueviz

If instead you installed glue with pip, you can update with::

    pip install glueviz --upgrade

Code reorganization
-------------------

In this release, a large fraction of the code has been reorganized, and imports
may need to be updated if you are using glue from scripts. Please see
:doc:`this <0.7_code_reorganization>` page for more details!
