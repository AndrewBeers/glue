Glue Documentation
==================

Glue is a Python framework to link visualizations of multiple related
datasets. It's goal is to let users easily inter-compare data across
several files.

Specifically, Glue tries to accomplish the following:

 * Provide the user with several modular visualizations for interacting with data (e.g. scatter plots, images, histograms, etc.)
 * Automatically convert between the coordinate spaces of different pieces of data
 * Permit users to define regions of interest, and have these propagate across data sets
 * Provide a sufficiently "pluggable" environment that Python programmers can customize Glue with new visulizations, data connections, etc.
